# Baba Is Z
Baba is Z is a Godot 4.2 project designed to bring the Baba Is You game into a 3D enviroment.

The structure of the project is designed to be close to how the actual game handles units and such.

As of now, parsing isnt really real, and is more like pattern detection. If someone is willing to take a look at the project and implement proper parsing for me, that'd be much appreciated
